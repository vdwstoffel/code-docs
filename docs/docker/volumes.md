# Volumes

## List all volumes

```bash
docker volume ls
```

## Remove a volume

```bash
docker volume rm <volume_name>
```

```bash
docker volume prune
```

## Named Volumes

Named volumes in Docker are a way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.
In this command, `volume_name` is the name of the volume and `/app/data` is the path in the container where the volume is mounted. If volume_name does not exist, Docker will create it.

```bash
docker run -v volume_name:/app/data my-docker-image
```

## Anonymous Volumes

They are used for data that persists while the container is running, but doesn't need to be kept after the container is removed.
In this command, `/app/data` is the path in the container where the anonymous volume is mounted. When the container is removed, the anonymous volume is also removed.

```bash
docker run -v /app/data my-image my-docker-image
```

## Bind Mounts

A bind mount in Docker is a method of attaching a specific directory or file from your host machine's filesystem directly into a Docker container. This allows the container to access and modify the files and directories on the host system as if they were part of the container's own filesystem. In this command, `/host/path` is the path on the host machine and `/container/path` is the path in the container where the host's directory is

```bash
docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container my-docker-image
```

## Remove all volumes

```bash
docker volume prune
```
